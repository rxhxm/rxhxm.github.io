I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Data Science. My research explores multimodal reasoning, vision-language models, and adversarial machine learning. ðŸ¤–

I have collaborated with MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) and UC San Diegoâ€™s Adaptive Computing and Embedded Systems (ACES) Lab on various research projects in these fields. I am passionate about applying research to enhance real-world applications, and I constantly seek new ways to leverage data science to drive innovation. ðŸ’¡

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong entrepreneurial background, having co-founded multiple startups. I co-founded Dart.cx, where we developed a conversational AI phone agent to answer over 180 patient calls for medical clinics. 

Prior to Dart.cx, I co-founded Socale, a social networking app that anonymously matches college students in the same class based on shared interests. The app garnered over 1,800 downloads, 13,000 messages, and 30,000 user sessions from UCSD students. ðŸ“±ðŸš€

Additionally, I founded RAZI, an organization that provides data-driven marketing strategies to startups and small businesses. I led a team of 47 students from universities such as UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UCI, and worked on marketing campaigns for startups valued at $3-7 million. Through RAZI, I also organized 36 workshops and hosted 7 prominent speakers in the entrepreneurial space. ðŸŽ¯
