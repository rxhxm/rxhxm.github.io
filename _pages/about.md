I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Data Science. My research explores multimodal reasoning, vision-language models, and adversarial machine learning. ðŸ¤–

I have collaborated with MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) and UC San Diegoâ€™s Adaptive Computing and Embedded Systems (ACES) Lab on various research projects in these fields. I am passionate about applying research to enhance real-world applications, and I constantly seek new ways to leverage data science to drive innovation. ðŸ’¡

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong entrepreneurial background, having co-founded multiple startups. I co-founded Dart.cx, where we developed a conversational AI phone agent to answer over 180 patient calls for medical clinics. 

Prior to Dart.cx, I co-founded Socale, a social networking app that anonymously matches college students in the same class based on shared interests. The app garnered over 1,800 downloads, 13,000 messages, and 30,000 user sessions from UCSD students. ðŸ“±ðŸš€

Additionally, I founded RAZI, an organization that provides data-driven marketing strategies to startups and small businesses. I led a team of 47 students from universities such as UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UCI, and worked on marketing campaigns for startups valued at $3-7 million. Through RAZI, I also organized 36 workshops and hosted 7 prominent speakers in the entrepreneurial space. ðŸŽ¯

------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
